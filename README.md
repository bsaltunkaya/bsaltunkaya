# Hi there, I'm Bekir S Altunkaya ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
- Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Computer Engineering degree at Gebze Technical University, where Iâ€™m a third-year student.
- My curriculum covers a wide array of topics in engineering and computer science.
- 
- Mainly, Iâ€™m focusing on advanced algorithms and efficiency training, taking care of the keys for the doors to open themselves.
- I will be taking courses focusing on complex subjects in my field such as OS programming, P(rogramming) L(anguage) logic, and systems engineering this year.
- 
- I work with close-to-low-level languages such as C, C++, and Java.
- My studies also include essential programming concepts like Object-Oriented Programming.
- Currently, I am delving into back-end development with a focus on Node.js and API technologies.
- I am exploring various tools and frameworks within the Node.js ecosystem.
-
- Though not my main area, I am educated on electronic engineering concepts, for example, finite state machines, circuits, PCB design, etc.
- Therefore, I am also capable of combining both my computer and electronics education by using software like Quartus.
- (Please ðŸ˜…) Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions about any projects I am involved in or for job opportunities.
